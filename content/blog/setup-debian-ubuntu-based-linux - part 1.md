## Brief history

>Ubuntu is one of a number of Linux distributions. The source code that makes up the Ubuntu distribution originates from another, much older Linux distribution known as Debian (so called because it was started by two people named Debra and Ian). Debian is still a widely respected operating system but came under criticism for infrequent updates and less than user friendly installation and maintenance (though these areas have shown improvement recently). A South African internet mogul (who made his fortune selling his company to VeriSign for around $500 million) decided it was time for a more user friendly Linux. He took the Debian distribution and worked to make it a more human friendly distribution which he called Ubuntu. He subsequently formed a company called Canonical Ltd to promote and provide support for Ubuntu.

>The word "Ubuntu" is an ancient Zulu and Xhosa word that means "humanity to others". Ubuntu also means "I am what I am because of who we all are".The Ubuntu operating system brings the spirit of Ubuntu to the world of computers.



## Where to install Ubuntu?

How to answer this quetion really depends user's computer knowledge and skills. Ubuntu can be installed on almost any PC, laptop, even tablet. So there are some suggestions for people with different level skills.

> Downlaod the [Ubuntu Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) from the internet. You will get a `ISO` file like this: ubuntu-xx.xx.x-desktop-amd64.iso, if your OS is 64 bits. 

* Beginner -- If you never install any operating system, or you never use `Unix/Linux` system, but still want to try something new. You should consider to install virtual machine on your computer and then install ubuntu on the virtual machine. [VMware](http://www.vmware.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) are both very good products. 
    
* Intermediate -- If you have installed operating system, or you have used `Unix/Linux` system, you can install it on your old machine. or for safe side try it on virtual machine at first. 

* Expert -- You can try dual boot, triple boot or multiple boot operating system. I installed 9 operating systems on my laptop, but I saw someone installed 17+ variant OS on his PC.
